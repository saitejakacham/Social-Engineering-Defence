My Best Prompts
Most Effective: Prompt #12
•	Why it worked well: It took a complex requirement (technical accuracy + transitions + strict time limit) and boiled it down to a perfect script that made recording the video very easy.
Most Improved: Prompt #2 (Evolved from Prompt 1)
•	How it evolved: Prompt 1 was a vague request for a document. Prompt 2 incorporated a specific persona (Cybersecurity Expert), defined the audience (Corporate), and set strict formatting constraints (Tables, Checklists), resulting in a much higher quality output.
Lessons Learned
What Worked:
1.	Iterative Refinement: Starting with a broad prompt (Prompt 1) and then asking the AI to "Optimize" it (Prompt 2) yielded better results than trying to write the perfect prompt from scratch.
2.	Persona Definition: Explicitly telling the AI to act as a "Cybersecurity Policy Advisor" or "Presentation Coach" significantly changed the tone to be more professional and appropriate for the task.
What Didn't Work:
1.	Time Estimation: Initial requests for "5 minutes" of text (Prompt 10) resulted in too many words. I learned that I need to ask for specific word counts (e.g., "250 words") rather than time limits.
2.	Context Loading: In early prompts, I didn't always specify the "Previous Speaker" and "Next Speaker." Adding those details in later prompts made the transitions much smoother.
